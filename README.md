# DevOps Sample App

## Overview

Welcome to the **DevOps Sample App**! This repository provides a simple implementation of **Build, Test, and Deploy** pipelines in a CI/CD environment. The project demonstrates the process of building and testing a Node.js application, containerizing it with Docker, and using a CI/CD pipeline to automate the build and test stages.

Currently, the CI/CD pipeline only implements the **Build** and **Test** stages, with plans to include **Deployment** in the future.

## Features

* **Node.js Application**: A simple Node.js application built and tested using `npm`.
* **Dockerization**: Dockerfile included to containerize the application.
* **CI/CD Implementation**: Automated build and test pipelines.
* **Scalable for Future Enhancements**: The pipeline can be extended to include deployment stages.

---

## Prerequisites

Before running the project, ensure that the following dependencies are installed:

* **Node.js** (v12 or higher)
* **npm** (Node Package Manager)
* **Docker** (for containerization)
* **CI/CD Tool** (e.g., GitHub Actions, Jenkins, or Travis CI) â€” this is required to run the build and test pipeline.

## Setup

To get started with this project locally, follow these steps:

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mukesh-ma/devops-sample-app.git
cd devops-sample-app
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

In the root directory of the project, run the following command to install the Node.js dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

This will install all the necessary packages as defined in the `package.json` file.

---

## Usage

Once the project is set up, you can run the application locally to verify that it works before building and testing it.

### 1. Run the Application

To run the Node.js application locally, execute:

```bash
npm start
```

This will start the web application on the default port (typically `http://localhost:3000`).

### 2. Running Tests

The application includes a basic test suite. You can run the tests with:

```bash
npm test
```

This will execute the tests defined in the project.

---

## CI/CD Pipeline

This repository uses a Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline to automate the **Build** and **Test** stages. The pipeline ensures that every change to the repository undergoes automated testing before merging into the main branch.

### Current Stages Implemented:

1. **Build**: The application is built using `npm install` to install dependencies and prepare the code for deployment.
2. **Test**: Unit and integration tests are executed to ensure the application is functioning correctly.

### Future Stages:

* **Deploy**: Future updates to this pipeline will include a deployment step to push the application to a server or cloud platform (e.g., AWS, Azure, or GCP).

---

## Dockerization

This project is Dockerized to ensure a consistent runtime environment. The `Dockerfile` included in the repository is used to create a container image for the application.

### 1. Build Docker Image

To build the Docker image, run the following command:

```bash
docker build -t devops-sample-app .
```

This will create a Docker image tagged as `devops-sample-app`.

### 2. Run Docker Container

Once the image is built, you can run the application in a Docker container:

```bash
docker run -p 3000:3000 devops-sample-app
```

This command will map the container's port 3000 to the host's port 3000, allowing you to access the application via `http://localhost:3000`.
